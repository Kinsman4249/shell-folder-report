## Contributing to shell-folder-report

Thanks for considering a contribution. This is a small project and the process is intentionally lightweight.

### How to report a bug

Open an issue using the Bug report template. Please include:
- The version of this project you are running (commit SHA or release tag)
- The exact command or workflow that triggered the issue
- The full error output (redact any secrets / credentials / personal data)
- Relevant log excerpts
- Your runtime environment (OS, PowerShell version, deployment target, etc.)

### How to propose a feature

Open an issue using the Feature request template. Describe the use case before the implementation. Knowing why is more useful than what in early discussion.

### How to submit a change

- Fork the repo and create a feature branch (git checkout -b feat/short-description).
- Make your change. Keep changes focused - one logical change per PR.
- Test it. See the Usage section in the README for how to run the script and verify its output locally.
- Lint it. Run any project-specific linters or formatters before pushing.
- Update documentation. If your change alters user-visible behavior, update the README and add a new numbered entry to CHANGELOG.md under the current round.
- Open a PR against main. Fill in the PR template.

### Coding conventions

- Follow the style of the surrounding code. Match formatting, naming, and structure of existing files.
- Comments should explain why, not what. The diff already shows what.
- No new dependencies without strong justification. The appeal of small projects is the small, predictable surface area.
- No telemetry, ever. This project must not phone home.

### Commit messages

Conventional Commits style is preferred but not required:
feat: add support for X
fix: handle empty response from Y
docs: clarify setup for Z
Keep the subject under 72 characters. Add a body if the change is not obvious from the diff.

### Releases

Maintainers cut releases by tagging vX.Y.Z on main. Pre-1.0 versioning rules:
- 0.X.0 for any user-visible change
- 0.X.Y for bug-fix-only patch releases
After 1.0, standard SemVer applies.
